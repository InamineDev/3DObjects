# 3DObjects
This project was mostly created for us, we just needed to look at the code and add a button and a shape. At this point I was very confused with how the 3D object points worked, so I created "Unknown". A many sided shape that makes no sense in any geometry class. 
This project was mostly to test our ability to read and learn from code, and then put that code to use to create our own things.
